# Shared Layer

This directory contains shared code for the Test App. As the application is a static landing page with no entities, data flows, or authentication, there are currently no shared contracts, types, or utilities.

## Purpose
- Provide a place for shared types, constants, and utilities if the app grows in the future.
- Enable stable imports for any cross-cutting concerns.

## Current State
- No shared modules are required for this version of the app.
