# ai-app-saas

## Project Overview
A SaaS starter monorepo featuring a React + Vite frontend, a Node.js + Express backend, and shared TypeScript utilities and types. Built for rapid AI-powered app development with a focus on code quality and developer experience.

## Monorepo Structure
- `frontend/` – React app (Vite, TypeScript)
- `backend/` – Node.js API (Express, TypeScript)
- `shared/` – Shared TypeScript code (types, utilities)
- `infra/` – Infrastructure configs, CI/CD, Docker, scripts

## Prerequisites
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) >= 18.x
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) (classic)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) (for containerized dev/production)

## Environment Variables
Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in required values:

**Required:**
- `JWT_SECRET` – Secret for JWT signing
- `NODE_ENV` – `development` or `production`
- `PORT` – Port for backend server (default: 3000)

**Optional:**
- `FRONTEND_URL` – URL for frontend (default: http://localhost:5173)
- `BACKEND_URL` – URL for backend (default: http://localhost:3000)
- `COOKIE_DOMAIN` – Domain for cookies
- `LOG_LEVEL` – Logging level (e.g., info, debug)

## Local Development
1. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   yarn install
   ```
2. Start both frontend and backend (from repo root):
   ```sh
   yarn dev
   ```
   - Frontend: http://localhost:5173
   - Backend: http://localhost:3000

## Building for Production
```sh
yarn build
```
Builds both frontend and backend for production output.

## Running with Docker
1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure variables.
2. Build and start services:
   ```sh
   docker-compose up --build
   ```
   - Frontend: http://localhost:5173
   - Backend: http://localhost:3000

## Code Quality (Linting & Formatting)
- Lint all code:
  ```sh
  yarn lint
  ```
- Format all code:
  ```sh
  yarn format
  ```

## CI/CD and GitHub Actions
Automated build, lint, and (future) test runs via GitHub Actions. See [`infra/.github/workflows/ci.yml`](infra/.github/workflows/ci.yml).

## API Endpoints Overview
See `backend/src/routes/` for available API endpoints and route handlers.

## Shared Types & Utilities
Shared code lives in `shared/` and is imported by both frontend and backend for type safety and DRY utilities.

## Troubleshooting & FAQ
- If ports are in use, change `PORT` and `FRONTEND_URL`/`BACKEND_URL` in your `.env`.
- If Docker volumes cause issues, try `docker-compose down -v` to reset.
- For monorepo workspace issues, ensure you are using Yarn classic (v1).
